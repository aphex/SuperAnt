====================================
Super ANT Builder for SublimeText 2
====================================

This plugin adds the ability to choose a target from an ANT build file in the root of your working folder in Sublime Text 2.


About
------------
This build system is based on the idea that you have a project with a single top level folder. This folder should house your project files along with a build.xml and other build files, in the root.

Updates 
------------
Added the ability to specify the ant build file. This can be accessed through the preferences menu within Sublime Text or the Command Palette under "Preferences : Super Ant - Settings". The settings file will also automatically be opened in the case that SuperAnt cannot file a build file in your project.


Prerequisites
------------
    ANT - http://ant.apache.org/


How to Use
------------

1) Install the plugin
2) Create a single folder project
3) Add Build.xml to the project
4) Select SuperAnt from your Tools -> BuildSystem
5) Select Tools -> Build
6) You will be presented with a list of all your ANT targets
7) Select the ANT target you wish to run
8) Enjoy!
